Project Description 

DevBook is a web application designed for professionals in the technology field where they can network and converse with likeminded individuals. In other words, the best way to describe it would a slimmed down version of Facebook targeted at the tech industry, hence the name DevBook. During my Co-op term I worked in a development shop in Toronto. It was a great experience, but I would say the best part of it was how much networking I did at tech events. I feel this helped my career just as much, if not more than the actual learning I did on the job. I thought to myself not everyone lives in a big city, not everyone has the time to attend large networking events so the likelihood of them networking is low. This is where DevBook comes into play. DevBook users can sign up for an account and build their online profile. They can link their projects, upload photos, search users based on specific criteria, chat with users, leave ratings on other users, and even make posts about their latest projects.
